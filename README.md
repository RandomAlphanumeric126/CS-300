DSA: Analysis and Design


What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course? 

  These projects were intended to explore three data structures (binary search trees, hash tables, and linked lists), and apply them to store, search, and sort a dataset of college courses.

        
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand. 

  I knew going into this project that data structures are a very important aspect of software development because many of the problems we seek to solve as developers involve dealing with data. Because each data structure has their own strengths and weaknesses, knowing when to use which can make the difference between an efficient and responsive application that performs to the satisfaction of all users, and a bowl of molasses poured from the peak of Mt. Everest.

        
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project? 

  The biggest struggles I had with this project was working with recursion and pointers. Both were still very new to me when I began, and even in closing are still an area in which I feel my skills will need continued development. My biggest roadblock with recursion was easily when working with binary search tree’s insertion code, particularly at the end (the code for which is not included within this repository). When working with the pointers used with my hashtable code, I struggled with mixing up when and why to make use of a pointer. This was exacerbated by my limited knowledge of the stack and the heap in memory. Both of these points will be a focus as I continue to further my skills in programming and software development. 

        
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs? 

  This project introduced me to concepts I haven’t seen before, particularly the concept of recursion. While I have some concerns of its usefulness when working with systems that provide limited resources (I suspect recursing too many times will result in stack overflows), for systems that do not have such deficiencies, recursion may make for code that is more readable, faster to write, and perhaps easier to maintain.

        
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 

  During this project I took the opportunity to experiment with different code styling techniques and worked on creating single responsibility functions and methods. While I do see there remains room for growth in both (and other) aspects, I will continue refining my abilities to keep code clean and easy to read, well commented, and succinct which will ensure my code remains as easy to work with as possible.
